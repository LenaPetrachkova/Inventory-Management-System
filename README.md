# Inventory Management System
In this code, I have implemented a simple inventory management system to manage a collection of products in a store. The program consists of 13 files: 6 header files (.hpp), 6 source files (.cpp) for classes, and 1 main source file (.cpp) where program execution begins.
In the main function, the program starts by creating an instance of the Inventory class, which represents the inventory management system. This instance is created using the default constructor of the Inventory class.
